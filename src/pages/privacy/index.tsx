      <p className="fs-5">
        We are not motivated to collect your data beyond what is required by law
        and to provide you with excellent user experiences. We strive to be
        transparent in the data we do collect. When you interact with the
        Services, we collect only:
      </p>
      <i>Publicly-available blockchain data</i>
      <p className="fs-5 mt-1">
        When you connect your non-custodial blockchain wallet to the Services,
        we may collect and log your publicly-available blockchain address to
        learn more about your use of the Services and to screen your wallet for
        any prior illicit activity. We may screen your wallet using intelligence
        provided by leading blockchain analytics providers. Note that blockchain
        addresses are publicly-available data that are not created or assigned
        by us or any central party, and by themselves are not personally
        identifying.
      </p>
      <i>Information from localStorage and other tracking technologies</i>
      <p className="fs-5 mt-1">
        We and our third-party services providers may access and collect
        information from localStorage, mobile deviceID, cookies, web beacons,
        and other similar technologies to provide and personalize the Services
        and features of the Services for you across sessions. For example, we
        may use this information to remember your preferences from a selection
        during donation checkout. We may also use this information to learn
        about your preferences, your use of the Services, and our interactions
        with you. Information we collect from these technologies may include
        things such as browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system,
        device or browser language, and other device information. We group and
        analyze these user journeys collectively, in the aggregate, to improve
        our product user experience.
      </p>
      <i>Information from other sources</i>
      <p className="fs-5 mt-1">
        We may receive information about your wallet address or transactions

      <i>Additional Notice to California Residents (“CCPA Notice”)</i>
      <p className="fs-5 mt-1">
        The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires certain
        businesses to provide a CCPA Notice to California residents to explain
        how we collect, use, and share their personal information, and the
        rights and choices we offer California residents regarding our handling
        of their information.
      </p>
      <i>Privacy Practices</i>

        the categories of parties with whom we share information.
      </p>
      <i>Privacy Rights</i>
      <p className="fs-5 mt-1">
        The CCPA gives individuals the right to request information about how we
        have collected, used, and shared your personal information. It also
        gives you the right to request a copy of any information we may maintain
        about you. You may also ask us to delete any personal information that
        we may have received about you. Please note that the CCPA limits these
        rights, for example, by prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive
        information in response to access requests and limiting the
        circumstances under which we must comply with a deletion request. We
        will respond to requests for information, access, and deletion only to
        the extent we are able to associate, with a reasonable effort, the
        information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in your
        request. If we deny the request, we will communicate the decision to
        you. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from

        individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information
        before providing a substantive response.
      </p>
      <i>Authorized Agents</i>
